# Deploy Azure Function
An azure function is deployed through azure pipelines.

There is no trigger or output binding implemented to connect to other Azure services

## Objective
Main purpose for creating this project is for me to test out the following on Azure:
```
1. Create a HTTP trigger function app
2. Implement CI/CD
3. Deploy the function app
```

## Disclaimer
There are additional setups needed to be done for this repo to work.  

The working version of this project with additional setups completed is on my private repository in Azure DevOps.
