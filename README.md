# TestHttpTriggerFunction
This is a http trigger azure function with no additional functionality implemented.

## Objective
Main purpose for creating this project is for me to test out the following on Azure:
```
1. Create a HTTP trigger function app
2. Implement CI/CD
3. Deploy the function app
```

## Disclaimer
There are additional setups needed to be done for this repo to work.  

The working version of this project with additional setups completed is on my private repository in Azure DevOps.
